This input files creates a unit cell of nickel, which is used to evaluate the radial distribution function over changes in temperature.

The unit cell of nickel is heated from 1 K to 5000 K and the rdf data is calculated every 500 steps.

The potential used for nickel is Ni_u3.eam

This script creates dump files used to visualize the nickel melting using OVITO.

Additionally, this script prints thermodynamic data that can be used to evaluate material properties.
