These codes evaluate 3 simulations of applying pressure, shear, and tension to a silicon-carbon lattice. 

The outputs can be evaluated to find bulk modulus, stress vs. strain curves, and stress tensor values. The stress vs. strain can also be evaluated for the x, y and z directions. 

These scripts can be used to evaluate important material properties when under different forces.
