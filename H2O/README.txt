These input scripts (1phase and 2phase) generate unit cells of water using the spce potential.

The 1phase input script contains one phase of water that can either melt or freeze. The 2 phase input script contains a unit cell at a temperature below the freezing point, and an adjacent unit cell at a temperature above the freezing point.

Both scripts create dump files used to visualize the phase changes using OVITO.

Additionally, 18 structures of ice in POSCAR format are provided in the structures folder. These structures can be input into these scripts using the lattice generator code.

These structures were found from the materials project website [1].
