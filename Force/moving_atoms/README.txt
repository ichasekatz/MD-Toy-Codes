This input file creates two atoms. Both atoms have a mass of 10 amu. 

These atoms are then placed in two different spots in the unit cell.
Atom 1: (25, 25, 25)
Atom 2: (30, 25, 25)

Then, a force of 10 eV/Angstrom is applied to the first atom in the x direction,
and a force of 10 eV/Angstrom is applied to the second atom in the y direction.

This script creates a dump file used to visualize the unit cell using OVITO.
