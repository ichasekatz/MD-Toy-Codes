This input file contains a diamond lattice of carbon, and uses the CH.airebo potential.

The unit cell is split into a top and bottom half.

The y direction is shrink-wrapped, while the x and z directions are periodic.

A force is applied to the -y direction in the top half, and +y direction in the bottom half.

These two forces are opposite, creating a dislocation in the lattice.

This script creates a dump file used to visualize the unit cell using OVITO.
