This input file creates a unit cell of nickel, which is used to evaluate structural changes during changes in temperature.

The unit cell of nickel is heated from 1 K to 5000 K and thermodynamic data is printed which can be used to evaluate material properties.

The potential used for nickel is Ni_u3.eam

This script creates dump files used to visualize the nickel melting using OVITO.
