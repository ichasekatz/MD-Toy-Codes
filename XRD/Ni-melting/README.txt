This input files create a unit cell of nickel, which is used to evaluate x-ray diffraction patterns over changes in temperature.

The unit cell of nickel is heated from 1 K to 5000 K and the xray data is calculated every 500 steps.

The potential used for nickel is Ni_u3.eam

This script creates dump files used to visualize the nickel melting using OVITO.

This script also prints thermodynamic data that can be used to evaluate material properties.
